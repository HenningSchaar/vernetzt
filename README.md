# Vernetzt

In this repo all relevant files for the Sound Art Installation *Vernetzt* are collected.

## Context

Travelling by train is a part of everyday life for a lot of people, whether they are commuting, visiting family or are living in a long distance relationship. Thus, the space in which life is experienced is expanded by the railway system, encompassing stations, railway lines and vehicles, as well as the places visited.

*Vernetzt* is an interactive sound art installation using train sounds manipulated by real time data of rail traffic. It uses webscraping to collect data, *p5.js* to produce visuals and *Max*, a node based development environment, for its sonification.
